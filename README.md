This project was created by Dima AbdelJaber. In this project, many of the demos was  used to help me create my code. The TAs also put in some help. In this project I started working on the assembly code but it wasnt working properly so i kept the .c file for the time. The timer.c does include the state machine. I got a lot of help from Felipe Lopez in it. He helped me with the make file. Jesus Garcia also helped me in creating my makefile and my assembly code. I got some help from mark Nunoz with my buzzer.c. I used some outside sources like Texas Instrument to help with my notes and my frequencies for the buzzer.c, This project was created for the MSP430

The following files are all of the .c files use:

buzzer.c (play notes)
led.c (lights)
project_main.c (main method)
state_machine.c (states of the program)
switches.c (state of buttons)
timer.c (timer used by state machine)

The following files are all of the .h files used which define everything used in the .c files:

buzzer.h 
led.h 
pitches.h
state_machine.h
switches.h
timer.h

The assembly code was implemented in the following file:

timer.s
